# Claude Code – Project Instructions

## Role
Act as a senior developer working autonomously on this project.
Prioritize code quality, clarity, and maintainability.

## Project context
This is a side project for portfolio purposes.
The codebase is already structured and should be improved, not rewritten.
Originally started with Expo Router, later adapted mainly for web usage.

## Tech stack
- Expo
- React / React Native
- TypeScript

## Coding philosophy
- Prefer simple, clean, and readable solutions
- Improve code proactively when patterns are weak or unclear
- Refactor when it meaningfully improves clarity or structure
- Avoid over-engineering and unnecessary abstractions

## TypeScript
- Prefer strong typing where it adds value
- `any` is acceptable when pragmatically justified
- Do not introduce complex or verbose types without clear benefit

## Autonomy & changes
- You may refactor, rename, and reorganize code without asking for confirmation
- Avoid destructive or large-scale changes unless clearly beneficial
- Assume changes are intentional and aligned with portfolio quality

## Testing
- Tests are optional
- You may suggest tests occasionally, but do not add them unless explicitly requested

## Communication
- Explain only significant design or architectural decisions
- Be concise and direct

## General
- Use English everywhere (code, comments, explanations)
